HighScores
	The top 3 highest scores are stored in /asteroids/scores/HighScores.txt
	Each time a game is completed we store the scores in HighScores.txt in a list 
	and add the score of the current game. The list is sorted and the lowest value is
	removed. The remaining 3 scores overwrite HighScores.txt and are then displayed on
	the screen below the legend "Game Over".
